This project aggregate nytimes county-level Covid-19 data to metro and micropolitan statistical areas and merges in population data. See the output folder for the resulting data set.

Source data from NYT is [here](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data). Their visuals are [here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html).

I use the resulting data to create [these visuals](https://public.tableau.com/profile/john5005#!/vizhome/Covid-19byRegion_15858546123960/OverTimeLogAxis) in Tableau public. Examples below:
